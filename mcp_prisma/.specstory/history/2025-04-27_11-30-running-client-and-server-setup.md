Okay, I can help with that. I will only propose one change or action at a time.

Based on the `server/README.md` file you provided, it seems the specific commands for starting the server and client are missing from the snippet.

Could you please provide the lines 5-12 from `server/README.md`? Alternatively, I can read that section of the file to find the specific commands for you.

Okay, I understand. I will read the relevant section of `server/README.md` to find the commands for starting the client and server.

---

Read file: server/README.md

---

It seems the commands are actually missing from the `server/README.md` file itself, not just the snippet you initially provided. The lines where the commands should be are blank.

Typically, for a Vite frontend and Express backend setup, the commands would look something like this:

1.  **Start the server:**
    *   Navigate to the server directory (likely named `server` or `backend`).
    *   Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) if you haven't already.
    *   Run `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`, or `node server.js` depending on the setup).
2.  **Start the client:**
    *   Navigate to the client directory (likely named `client` or `frontend`).
    *   Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) if you haven't already.
    *   Run `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`).

Could you tell me the names of the directories for the client and server? Or I can list the contents of the root directory to find them.

Okay, I will create the `.env` file in the `server` directory for you. I promise to only make one change at a time.

I will create an empty `.env` file inside the `server` directory. You can add your environment variables there later.

```diff
- 
+  
```

The empty `.env` file has been created in the `server` directory. Let me know what you'd like to do next!

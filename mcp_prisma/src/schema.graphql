NOTE: This GraphQL schema currently serves as a reference definition for the 
survey data structures. The canonical validation schemas are defined using Zod 
in 'survey.zod.ts', and the database schema is defined in 'schema.prisma'. 

This file is NOT used to run a GraphQL server for this project. It can be 
maintained for documentation purposes or potentially removed if the Zod and 
Prisma schemas are considered the sole sources of truth.
